for things like...
- reading data from USB port on pc
- reading data from USB port on raspberry pi
- detecting contours on an image using opencv
- reading frames from a usb webcam eg opencv imread source 0
- extracting frames from a video
- adding annotations onto frames before forming them onto a video
- combining frames into a video
- Doing Histogram Equalisation (HE) on RGB images (traditionally HE is only done on single channel/greyscale)
- Doing CLAHE on RGB images (similarly, traditionally CLAHE is only done on single channel/greyscale)
- Auto brightness contrast adjustment (adapted from some code found on stackoverflow to fit RGB images instead of single channel)
